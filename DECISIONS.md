# DECISIONS.md — Locked-in Decisions for FMS Editor Project

**Last updated:** Phase 1.5 H-G next  
**Maintained by:** Project owner (Teerapab)  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all decisions made — Claude Code MUST follow these.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions

### D-001: Storage strategy — Postgres JSON, no new tables
**Decision:** Use `SystemConfig.pageLayout Json?` and similar JSON columns.  
**Rejected:** New tables for templates/designs/configs.  
**Reason:** Avoid Prisma migrations during active dev; JSON is flexible enough for 5-10 year scope; admin doesn't need queryable data.

### D-002: Add `globalConfig Json?` field to SystemConfig
**Decision:** New JSON column for cross-cutting global config.  
**Rejected:** Embed in `pageLayout` (semantically wrong — not a layout).  
**Reason:** Globals deserve own field; mirrors existing `pageLayout` / `themeConfig` pattern.

### D-003: Click-lock at 2 layers (Capture phase)
**Decision:** EditorElement uses `onClickCapture` + `preventDefault`. LivePreview container has fallback capture handler for navbar/unwrapped clicks.  
**Reason:** Two-layer prevents both child handlers (signIn, Link) and Navbar links from firing.

### D-004: Real components only in editor preview (NO mocks)
**Decision:** ห้าม dummy component JSX. Always use the real production component (e.g., `<ResultCard />`) with synthesized props.  
**Reason:** User needs to see exactly what production renders so design decisions are accurate.  
**Exception:** Demo DATA is OK (e.g., `DUMMY_RESULTS_MULTI`).

### D-005: Single-source rendering (Hero pattern)
**Decision:** ALL components render through one path — `editorMode` doesn't fork JSX. The same JSX tree handles both modes; only `<Wrap>` differs.  
**Reason:** Avoids `editorBlocks` problem (mock JSX drifting from real). Hero pioneered this pattern in H-5.

### D-006: State-aware via `forceState` prop (preview only)
**Decision:** Stateful components accept `forceState` prop. When set, skip runtime detection and use that state. Production never passes `forceState`.  
**Reason:** Allows StatefulGallery to render every state side-by-side without messing with real-time logic.

### D-007: Pill background editable in countdown
**Decision:** Even though production uses `bg-white` constant, expose `pillBackground` token so admin can theme.  
**Reason:** Neon template needs dark pill — flexibility > simplicity.

### D-008: 1 element ID for countdown (not split badge/digits)
**Decision:** Single `hero-countdown` registry entry. Per-state config covers badge + digits + pill.  
**Reason:** Simpler admin UX; can split later if needed.

### D-009: Winner ResultCard = separate element (planned for H-7b)
**Decision:** `result-card` (regular) + `result-card-winner` (winner styling).  
**Rejected:** Single element with winner modifier.  
**Reason:** Winner has distinctly different design (yellow border, Trophy, gold gradient) — admin should edit it independently.

### D-010: Click-lock allowed inside EditorElement
**Decision:** LivePreview capture handler uses `e.target.closest('.group\\/editor')` to detect editor wraps and let those clicks through. Only blocks clicks NOT in a wrap.  
**Reason:** EditorElement still needs onClick to fire for selection.

## 🎨 Design / UX Decisions

### D-101: Templates locked = legacy preserved
**Decision:** Once a Created Template is finalized, it cannot be edited or deleted — only cloned/used.  
**Reason:** Legacy preservation. รุ่นน้องไม่ลบงานรุ่นพี่ได้.

### D-102: Tier 3 controls (Simple / Advanced / Expert)
**Decision:** PropertyPanel/Gallery uses tiered controls:
- Simple: 5-7 critical inputs (text, color, radius)
- Advanced: 10+ refined controls (gradient, padding, shadow)
- Expert: raw CSS (letter-spacing, line-height, transform)

**Reason:** Don't overwhelm new admin; let advanced user dig deeper.

### D-103: 4 cards in ResultCard gallery
**Decision:** Gallery shows 4 visual states:
- ก่อนเริ่ม (isWaiting)
- กำลังนับ ปิดผล (showHidden)
- ผลออกแล้ว (showScore non-winner)
- ผู้ชนะ (showScore + winner)

**Reason:** Realistic representation of all production scenarios.

### D-104: Default editor preview = showScore + ENDED + revealed
**Decision:** Results page editor preview defaults to "results revealed" state because it's the visually richest.  
**Future:** Add state toggle similar to vote sim mode.

### D-105: Multi vs Single party scenario differs
**Decision:**
- Multi: 2+ parties + abstain (NO disapprove)
- Single: 1 party + abstain + disapprove

**Reason:** Reflects production logic — disapprove only makes sense when validating a single party.

### D-106: Static background colors only (NO gradient pill bg yet)
**Decision:** Phase 1.5 templates use solid `pillBackground`. Gradient pill is future work.  
**Reason:** Lower complexity now; admin can use gradient on individual phases via `backgroundType: gradient` for flexible elements.

## 📦 Data / Config Decisions

### D-201: ELECTION_YEAR is "next year" placeholder, NOT academic year
**Decision:** `ELECTION_YEAR = "2027"` means "see you 2027" (next election cycle), not academic year.  
**Academic year:** stored as `globalConfig.academicYearTh` = 2569 (Thai BE).

### D-202: Global config has both atomic + pre-formatted fields
**Decision:** Some fields like `electionName` ("SAMO 49") are pre-formatted; others like `electionNamePrefix` + `electionNumber` are atomic for split rendering.  
**Reason:** HeroBlock needs split (SAMO + 49 with gradient on 49). Other places need full string.

### D-203: ElectionConfig.js stays for now
**Decision:** Don't migrate dates from `electionConfig.js` to DB until `H-ELECTION-CONFIG-EDIT` phase 4.  
**Reason:** Cascading complexity — Countdown, AutoIntro, results status all read from it. Big change.

### D-204: Image storage = Docker volume (local) for now
**Decision:** Use Docker volume mount for uploaded images. Setup verification in `H-IMG-LIB`.  
**Rejected:** Cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for now.  
**Reason:** User confirmed local works for their deploy setup.  
**Note:** If volume not configured, must set up before image upload feature.

### D-205: Banner image = hardcoded for now
**Decision:** `samo49_1.png` stays hardcoded until image library is built.  
**Visibility toggle** is editable now via element config.

## 🔄 Workflow / Tooling Decisions

### D-301: Diagnose-first for major steps
**Decision:** Before any step that touches code with unknown structure, write a `DIAGNOSE_*.md` spec for Claude Code to read + report back.  
**Reason:** Multiple incidents where assumed structure was wrong. Diagnose prevents.

### D-302: Use Sonnet for wiring, Opus for refactors
**Decision:**
- **Sonnet:** wiring, copy-paste, diagnose, follow-spec implementation
- **Opus:** complex refactors, schema design, cross-cutting changes

### D-303: Spec format with EXECUTION RULES
**Decision:** Every spec includes "DO NOT EXCEED" scope + verification + report format.  
**Reason:** Claude Code tends to over-extend; tight bounds prevent drift.

### D-304: "I wrote this spec myself" prefix
**Decision:** All Claude Code prompts begin with "I wrote this spec myself" to bypass prompt-injection paranoia.  
**Reason:** Claude Code refuses to read project files thinking they're attacks.

### D-305: Build verification required after each step
**Decision:** Spec ends with "verify npm run build". User reports back results.  
**Reason:** Catch breakage early before next step.

### D-306: NO automation — semi-manual phase batches
**Decision:** Reject full-automation approach. Use phase batches with human verification between.  
**Reason:** Diagnose-driven approach can't be automated; user feedback critical for vision alignment.

### D-307: GitHub commit after each step (recommended)
**Decision:** User commits after each step passes. Allows easy revert.  
**Reason:** ~25 steps × 1 commit = clean history + safety net.

## 🐛 Pitfall Log

### P-LOG-001: [2026-05-09] H-3PAGES-PREV — Duplicate Wraps + Missing Null Guard
**Context:** Adding editor previews for vote/candidates/closed pages  
**Problems:**
- VoteEditorPreview added `<Wrap id="vote-header-*">` but MultiPartyView already wrapped the same IDs internally → duplicate element IDs, both highlight on select
- `DUMMY_PARTIES_MULTI` had `logoUrl: null` → `getPath(null)` → `null.startsWith('/')` crash at candidates preview render
- LivePreview has no error boundary → on crash, stale previous DOM persists, user sees wrong page content  

**Fix:** Remove outer Wraps from VoteEditorPreview (let MultiPartyView own them), fix dummy data logoUrl, add null guard to getPath()  
**Lesson:** When writing an EditorPreview wrapper, ALWAYS read what Wraps already exist inside the wrapped component first. Don't assume the target is "naked content."

### P-LOG-002: [2026-05-10] H-SUCCESS-FIX — Including Production Auth/Nav Components in EditorPreview

**Context:** Writing SuccessEditorPreview for admin editor panel  
**Symptom:** EditorPreview included `<Navbar />` (which contains session/auth logic) and `<SiteFooter />` — neither of which production /success renders. Preview looked visually wrong and imported unnecessary side effects.  
**Root cause:** Author pattern-matched to HomeContent (which has Navbar) instead of reading production /success source.  
**Fix:** Full rewrite in H-SUCCESS-PREV-FIX; stripped Navbar/SiteFooter; marked component with explicit comment: "NO Navbar, NO SiteFooter, full-screen centered card"  
**Lesson:** Production pages vary wildly in which shell components they include. Never assume EditorPreview needs Navbar/Footer — read the real page first.  
**Mitigation rule:** Before writing any `*EditorPreview.js`, open the corresponding production `src/app/[page]/page.js` and grep for `<Navbar` and `<SiteFooter` to confirm which are actually present.

### P-LOG-003: [2026-05-10] H-SUCCESS-FIX — Missing simMode Toggle on New EditorPreview

**Context:** Writing SuccessEditorPreview for a page with locked/unlocked visual states  
**Symptom:** H-SUCCESS-FIX delivered an EditorPreview with zero state toggle, even though /success has two clearly distinct visual states (locked: dark form button + gray locked button; unlocked: emerald done badge + purple results button). Admin could not inspect both states.  
**Root cause:** The step spec didn't diagnose the state machine first. Since the simMode toggle pattern (established in H-3PAGES-PREV for vote/closed) wasn't documented in the step requirements, it was skipped.  
**Fix:** H-SUCCESS-PREV-FIX added `simMode` prop + 2-button toggle in PageDesignTab left panel, following the exact vote/closed pattern.  
**Lesson:** Any page that has distinct visual states (locked/unlocked, waiting/ended, multi/single) MUST have a simMode toggle in its EditorPreview. Check for state forks in production source before writing the spec.  
**Mitigation rule:** When writing a new `*EditorPreview` spec, grep the production page for `useState` and `if (is` branches. Any fork that changes visible layout = one simMode toggle button per fork.

### P-LOG-004: [2026-05-10] H-SUCCESS-FIX — Generic EditorPreview Written Without Reading Production Source

**Context:** Writing SuccessEditorPreview to show admin what /success page looks like  
**Symptom:** Delivered component had wrong title, wrong card content, wrong button labels, wrong background, wrong hooks — nothing matched production. Required a full DIAGNOSE step + rewrite step to fix.  
**Root cause:** `src/app/success/page.js` was never read before writing the EditorPreview. Component was built from analogy to other pages.  
**Fix:** Added DIAGNOSE_SUCCESS_PAGE_REAL step to catalog every production element first, then H-SUCCESS-PREV-FIX rewrote using that catalog.  
**Lesson:** An EditorPreview that doesn't match production is worse than no preview — it gives admin false design information. Cost of reading production first: 5 min. Cost of writing it wrong and fixing: 2 sessions.  
**Mitigation rule:** Before writing any `*EditorPreview`, read the full production page source and write a render-order list in the spec: "1. check icon circle, 2. title, 3. subtitle, 4. activity card..." Only start writing JSX once every visible element is listed.

## 🚫 Rejected Approaches

### R-001: ❌ HeroBlock as the editable hero
**Decision:** HeroBlock.js is dead code. HomeContent renders inline.  
**Future:** Either delete HeroBlock or make HomeContent use it. Not urgent.

### R-002: ❌ Reuse StatsBlock for results page
**Decision:** Visual design too different (Bento vs row). Use distinct `ResultsStatsBar`.

### R-003: ❌ Cloud storage for images (Phase 1)
**Decision:** Use Docker volume per user preference.

### R-004: ❌ Single ResultCard element with winner modifier
**Decision:** Two elements (regular + winner) for independent admin control.

### R-005: ❌ Hardcoded UI text per step
**Decision:** Use globalConfig once H-CON migration completes.

## 🔮 Future Decisions (Pending)

### P-001: Component Library tab structure
**TBD:** Filter UI, layout, browse-only experience.

### P-002: Admin authentication for new tabs
**TBD:** Use existing RSA admin token; verify pattern works for new APIs.

### P-003: Election date editor UX
**TBD:** Calendar picker vs raw input. Validation rules.

### P-004: Mobile editor experience
**TBD:** Touch-friendly Gallery. Possibly different layout.

### P-005: Backup/export feature for admin
**TBD:** Export all globalConfig + designs as JSON for archive.

## 📋 Convention Reminders (also in CLAUDE.md)

- All URLs via `getPath()` (basePath /fms-ovs)
- Admin API requires RSA-encrypted token via `x-admin-token` header
- Primary: `#8A2680`, Accent: `#9333EA`, Background: `#F8F9FD`
- `Candidate.number = 0` → งดออกเสียง
- `Candidate.number = -1` → ไม่รับรอง
- `Candidate.number > 0` → พรรคจริง
- Multi-party: NO disapprove (`-1`) hidden
- Single-party: HAS disapprove
- Valid voter years: `['ปี 1', 'ปี 2', 'ปี 3', 'ปี 4']`
- Tailwind only (no custom CSS files)
- All admin-edit data → JSON in DB, never new tables
- Static text → globalConfig (after H-CON)
